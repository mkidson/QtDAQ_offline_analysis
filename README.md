# Installing
We will be installing this package as a python module, using the standard python installer, pip. 

To do this we can start by navigating to the `src` directory and running `pip install .`

This should make it importable as a module just like numpy or matplotlib.

# Examples
The `analysis_examples.ipynb` file includes a sort of step-by-step introduction to using the package to 
extract L and S from `.dat` files produced by QtDAQ. It requires some example data, which could be any 
data from QtDAQ, but in this case can be found on the MeASURe Vula site at `MeASURe/Neutrons/dDAQ development/MilesMSc`.
